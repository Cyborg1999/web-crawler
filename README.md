# Web Crawler

The Project is a nodeJs Based webcrawling application. The user can access from the console and obtain information on the websites and the links within the website. The resulting web crawl provides the user with a summary of the crawl.

## Instructions

Once one has downloaded the file to their local machines.The user will have to update the necessary libraries using the following command on the terminal.

``` bash
    npm start
```

Once the libraries are in place you can run the project using the command `npm start` then the name of the website.e.g.

``` bash
    npm run "website URL"
```

Once the command have run on the terminal and executed the user should be able to get a report on the number of links and the number of times the links have been used.
